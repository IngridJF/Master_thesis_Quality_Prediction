The codes uploaded to this GitHub repository are developed and used in the author's master's thesis titled "Predicting Marble Quality from Measurement
While Drilling (MWD) Data Using Machine Learning". Th models are trained and tunes trough Python-programming.  The codes are set under three different branches in the repository, based on the input data the models are trained on. 
The data used to trained the models cannot be shared due to a confidentiality agreement. The data contains MWD parameters as well as corresponding quality measurements.
